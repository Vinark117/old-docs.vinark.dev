# Introduction to rule tiles

Rule tiles in unity are a better way to paint tiles to a grid. When using just regular tiles you need to place every edge and corner manually, which can be really time consuming. Rule tiles adapt to their surroundings, and set the edges/corners according to the rules you specified.

When selecting a new rule tile in the inspector, you can see a list of **tiling rules**. This is where you can add as many rules as there are tiles in the tileset. If there is a tile image for which you donâ€™t wish to create a rule, simply exclude it.

You can add **tiling rules** by clicking the **+** button. A **tiling rule** has the same options as a default tile, with one exception: you can specify in the small **grids** when should this tile be placed.

When the grid cell shows a **green arrow** (the rule is set to **this**), the tile is continuous. If you set that place to a **red X** (the rule **not this**), there's no tile in that position.

When placing down the tile it will check all **tiling rules** from top to bottom. If all the places match with the rules we specified, that **tiling rule** will show on our tilemap. If at least one of the specified rules do not match with the tiles' surroundings, it will skip to the next **tiling rule**. If none if the tiling rules match the defaults will be used.
